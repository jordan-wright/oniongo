Onionoo API Rewritten in golang

Summary
-------

Oniongo is a rewrite of the popular [Onionoo API](https://onionoo.torproject.org/) created by the Tor Project. I have written about this API on my [blog](http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2013/09/mapping-tor-relays-and-exit-nodes.html), and I thought it would be a good exercise in Golang to rewrite it.
